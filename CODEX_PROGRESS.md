# Fitness tracker checkpoint — 23 September 2026

## Findings and decision

- Existing workspace contains the Friends Showdown, scraper, and personal-site projects; no fitness app existed.
- Chose an isolated Node 24 app with built-in SQLite, `crypto.scrypt`, opaque HttpOnly sessions, and a vanilla mobile client. No existing site, DNS, Azure resource, or production auth was changed.
- Repository: `https://github.com/Caryourday96/fitness-tracker`.

## Implemented

- First-account setup lock and login/logout with hashed passwords and 30-day sessions.
- Private profile, check-in, deterministic plan, workout, measurements, and food inventory tables.
- Safety stop for concerning symptoms and blood pressure at or above 180/120; history remains accessible.
- Today flow requires check-in before plan confirmation; plan reasons and safety guidance are shown.
- Resume/save/complete workout flow, set logging, settings, inventory, and CSV check-in export.
- Product, safety-source, deployment, and prioritized backlog docs.

## Verification

- `node --test`: 6 tests passed (hashing, urgent gates, deterministic adaptation, timezone format).
- Local HTTP smoke: `/` returned 200 and `/api/status` returned unauthenticated status.
- GitHub commit `46ad357` pushed to `main`.
- No Azure/DNS/deployment approval was requested or performed.

## Risks / remaining work

- Before personal use: CSRF, rate limiting, recovery/revocation UI, HTTPS-only production cookie, managed durable database, private object storage, upload validation, historical editing, end-of-day flow, charts, and broader mobile/browser tests remain.
- SQLite is suitable for local development only unless a persistent mounted volume is guaranteed.
- Medical thresholds and wording need clinician review before treating this as medical guidance.

## Exact next action

Add CSRF protection and login rate limiting, then add integration tests proving unauthenticated access is denied and state-changing cross-site requests are rejected. Do not deploy until the P0 backlog is addressed and reviewed.

## Daily food, sleep, activity and cardio tracking — 23 September 2026

- Added durable `food_logs`, `sleep_logs`, and `activity_logs` tables and protected API routes.
- Added daily food/snack, sleep-hours/quality, activity duration, steps, and treadmill-specific duration/distance/incline fields to the Today flow.
- Treadmill plans now show conservative speaking-pace settings rather than weight/reps. Strength fields remain load/reps based.
- The app explicitly explains that manual wearable/Apple Health entry is available now; private screenshot upload/OCR remains deferred until storage validation.
- Existing deterministic safety tests remain passing; a full browser integration check is still needed after this UI extension.
- Next: add history-based, user-confirmed load suggestions and weekly charts after the P0 auth/storage work.

## Private image storage implementation — 23 September 2026

- Added authenticated upload/list/read/delete endpoints for PNG and JPEG data URLs.
- Files are stored under `data/uploads` outside `public/`, with randomized names, 0600 file mode, 5 MB maximum, declared-type checks, PNG/JPEG magic-byte checks, private no-store responses, and user ownership checks.
- Added an `uploads` metadata table keyed to the account and day. No public image URLs are issued.
- Production still requires a persistent private volume or private object storage and backup/restore testing; Azure deployment is not yet performed.
- Verification still needed: authenticated integration tests for cross-user access denial, malformed signatures, size limits, deletion, and browser upload UI.

# Fitness tracker checkpoint — 23 September 2026

## Findings and decision

- Existing workspace contains the Friends Showdown, scraper, and personal-site projects; no fitness app existed.
- Chose an isolated Node 24 app with built-in SQLite, `crypto.scrypt`, opaque HttpOnly sessions, and a vanilla mobile client. No existing site, DNS, Azure resource, or production auth was changed.
- Repository: `https://github.com/Caryourday96/fitness-tracker`.

## Implemented

- First-account setup lock and login/logout with hashed passwords and 30-day sessions.
- Private profile, check-in, deterministic plan, workout, measurements, and food inventory tables.
- Safety stop for concerning symptoms and blood pressure at or above 180/120; history remains accessible.
- Today flow requires check-in before plan confirmation; plan reasons and safety guidance are shown.
- Resume/save/complete workout flow, set logging, settings, inventory, and CSV check-in export.
- Product, safety-source, deployment, and prioritized backlog docs.

## Verification

- `node --test`: 6 tests passed (hashing, urgent gates, deterministic adaptation, timezone format).
- Local HTTP smoke: `/` returned 200 and `/api/status` returned unauthenticated status.
- GitHub commit `46ad357` pushed to `main`.
- No Azure/DNS/deployment approval was requested or performed.

## Risks / remaining work

- Before personal use: CSRF, rate limiting, recovery/revocation UI, HTTPS-only production cookie, managed durable database, private object storage, upload validation, historical editing, end-of-day flow, charts, and broader mobile/browser tests remain.
- SQLite is suitable for local development only unless a persistent mounted volume is guaranteed.
- Medical thresholds and wording need clinician review before treating this as medical guidance.

## Exact next action

Add CSRF protection and login rate limiting, then add integration tests proving unauthenticated access is denied and state-changing cross-site requests are rejected. Do not deploy until the P0 backlog is addressed and reviewed.

## Daily food, sleep, activity and cardio tracking — 23 September 2026

- Added durable `food_logs`, `sleep_logs`, and `activity_logs` tables and protected API routes.
- Added daily food/snack, sleep-hours/quality, activity duration, steps, and treadmill-specific duration/distance/incline fields to the Today flow.
- Treadmill plans now show conservative speaking-pace settings rather than weight/reps. Strength fields remain load/reps based.
- The app explicitly explains that manual wearable/Apple Health entry is available now; private screenshot upload/OCR remains deferred until storage validation.
- Existing deterministic safety tests remain passing; a full browser integration check is still needed after this UI extension.
- Next: add history-based, user-confirmed load suggestions and weekly charts after the P0 auth/storage work.

## Private image storage implementation — 23 September 2026

- Added authenticated upload/list/read/delete endpoints for PNG and JPEG data URLs.
- Files are stored under `data/uploads` outside `public/`, with randomized names, 0600 file mode, 5 MB maximum, declared-type checks, PNG/JPEG magic-byte checks, private no-store responses, and user ownership checks.
- Added an `uploads` metadata table keyed to the account and day. No public image URLs are issued.
- Production still requires a persistent private volume or private object storage and backup/restore testing; Azure deployment is not yet performed.
- Cost decision: use Azure App Service Free F1 only as a disposable technical preview; do not store real health data or private images there. Production needs durable storage and a paid/appropriate tier.

## Azure plan upgrade — 23 September 2026

- User approved upgrading the shared `Kayode_IGO` App Service Plan `adeticket`.
- Azure CLI verified the plan is now Canada Central, Premium v3 `P0v3`, one worker.
- This affects all apps on that plan and increases billing. The fitness app itself is not yet healthy on the existing Windows runtime; the next step is either a Windows-compatible entry point or a separate Linux plan.

## Linux preview deployed — 23 September 2026

- Broken Windows fitness Web App was removed and recreated as `fitness-tracker-ca` on separate Linux B1 plan `fitness-linux-b1` in Canada Central.
- Current live verification passed: `https://fitness-tracker-ca.azurewebsites.net/` returned HTTP 200 and the app hero; `/api/status` returned `{"authenticated":false,"hasUser":false}`.
- Friends Showdown remains on the shared Windows B1 plan `adeticket`.
- No custom domain or real health data has been connected. Before personal use, configure backups, persistent storage expectations, and the GitHub OIDC workflow.

## Azure GitHub OIDC prepared — 23 September 2026

- Created managed identity `fitness-tracker-github` in `Kayode_IGO`, scoped Contributor only to the `fitness-tracker-ca` Web App.
- Added federated trust for `Caryourday96/fitness-tracker` main branch.
- Repository still needs the three GitHub Actions secrets added by the owner; no secret values are stored in this checkpoint.
- Verification still needed: authenticated integration tests for cross-user access denial, malformed signatures, size limits, deletion, and browser upload UI.
